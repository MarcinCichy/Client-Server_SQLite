    Client/Server application.

    It is a simple client server application.
    The app uses JSON to send commands and server responses.

    In this version, only one user can connect to the server at a time.

    On the user side, a graphical user interface based on the Curses module was created, which simulates the behavior of old terminals.

    The user must log in to use the connection. The server checks if the user exists in the database and if he is not locked out. 
    If these conditions are met, the user is logged in. As you enter your password, it is masked with asterisks.

    From the GUI, the user can check the contents of his mailbox, read the message, delete the message and send the message to another user.

    There can be a maximum of 5 messages in the inbox. If someone sends a message and it turns out that the recipient's inbox is full, 
    they will receive a message about it and the message will not be sent.

    When writing a message, the number of characters that have already been used is shown on the fly. 
    The message cannot be longer than 250 characters. After reaching this value, it is not possible to continue writing messages.
    Then shorten the message to the required number of characters.
    When editing a message, you can navigate through its content and use the LEFT/RIGHT cursor keys to use the BACKSPACE and DELETE keys.

    If the User has administrator rights, he can also create a new account, delete an existing one, 
    change the status of another user (active or blocked), he can also change user rights (admin or user).

    Run server.py and run gui.py.
